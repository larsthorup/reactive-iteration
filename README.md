# reactive-iteration

How can we efficiently render a long list of items where the items can change? 
We only want to re-render the items that changes, not the entire list. 

Here we use a technique where we "pass a hook as a prop".

This is useful for implementing reusable components that display large amounts of data, like tables, trees and charts.
